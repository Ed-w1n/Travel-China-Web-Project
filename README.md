# Travel China Web Project
## Background
This is a website project for GNG 5124 course of University of Ottawa. At the beginning of the course, we had a crazy idea: we always develop website using popular framworks such as Spring, SpringMVC, React, etc. what if we develop a web project **without** using any of those frameworks? Then this project exists.

## Tools
Java, HTML, JQuery, CSS, AJAX, Bootstarp, MySql, Maven
For front-end, native HTML and JQuery are used. For back-end, there are three layers: web layer where servlets are applied, service layer and dao layer where JDBC and Druid datasource are applied.
